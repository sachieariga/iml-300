      <p1> Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology reminds me of middle school<br>
       when I wanted to join the Computer Science club. Coding was something I always <br>
       wanted to try in a classroom setting; however, because the club at my school <br>
       was was male-dominated, I shyed away from it. Despite this experience, I am <br>
       thankful to be living in a time where it is becoming increasingly normalized for <br> women to be part of the computer science industry. They are being seen <br>
       more as “programmers” rather than “female programmers.” <br><br>

One artist that really stood out to me in “Artist in Computer” was Leslie Mezei.<br>
     Her ‘Bikini Shifted’ piece was very interesting, as she distorted her image <br>
     in 121 different ways on a 11 x 11 grid. She presented these images in a way where<br>
      it looks like a flip book. As an artist who struggles to try out new patterns or <br>
      compositions in creative works, I admire the way she is able to create so many <br> different iterations within her pieces.

      <p1> This reading was very thought-provoking for me, especially as a Media Arts <br>
      student who doesn't know much about computer terms and the history of computers. <br>
      The way that the author merged the discussion of tech with race was interesting; 
      <br>
      for example, when it was mentioned that the transition from a black screen to a <br>
      white screen on computers is a metaphor for the erasure of blackness, and the <br>
      whiteness of the tech industry. I also took note of the visual layout of the <br>
      article. The background is black throughout, and the text is white. This design <br>
      relates to the writing especially when it says that “Blackness has, so to say, <br>
      formed the ground for white, with black gooey being antithetical to the values <br>
      of the white screen, (page 42).</p1>

      <p1>I found the reading interesting because it discussed "mediated" <br>
      and "unmediated" content. Both this and the lecture on the beginning of the <br>
      Internet made me want to compare the entertainment I consume online now vs when <br>
      I first discovered the Internet. I wasn’t old enough to be using apps like <br>
      Rando (mentioned in the writing); however, I do remember how amazed I was when <br>
      I made friends on online magazine forums under the name “PuppyAndNatureLover777.” <br>
      There wasn't an algorithm suggesting me to read certain comments or posts; I <br>
      would simply scroll through the websites for hours, reading archived articles. <br>
      Going back to Rando, I feel as though the app BeReal is a more developed version <br>
      of it. Users are able to view a moment of random people’s days, everyday at a <br>
      certain time. Users can record the location of the photo, “react” to others’ images <br>
      via a selfie, and add a simple caption. It is interesting how an app with such <br>
      a simple and random concept trended worldwide this year.

      <p1>In the first portion Lauren McCarthy’s Eyeo talk, she discusses her “Following <br>
      project” where she follows and observes strangers out in public. Although she was <br>
      curious about how strangers around her lived their lives, McCarthy also aimed to <br>
      find home through her project, as she had just moved to New York City and wished to <br>
      explore her space. I often find myself looking at my phone or being distracted while <br>
      walking on the streets, so it would be a refreshing experience to closely observe <br>
      my surroundings. The presentation was also about Lauren, which is a human version of <br>
      Amazon’s Alexa. I thought it was interesting that the speaker investigated the <br>
      contrast between two opinions many have about modern technology: fearing surveillance <br>
      vs wanting to be observed on platforms like social media. </p1>
     <br>

     <h1>reading 5</h1>
      <p1>“In Defense of the Poor Image” discusses the presence of poor images, which have <br>
      low resolution, spread quickly, and are remixed many times. Hito compares these images <br>
      to imperfect cinema, which is amateurish and blurs “the distinction between consumer<br>
       and producer, audience and author.” (page 39) Similarly, poor images can be seen as <br>
       “popular images” that can be accessed and created by large communities. This is <br>
       beneficial because they could form common interest between people who could not <br>
       interact otherwise, but can also cause hate speech and misleading content. The <br>
       writing really made me think about how I create, share, and view poor images online. <br>
       I feel as though the “rough” format of these images provide a great sense of <br>
       relatability; however, they could definitely be used the wrong way very easily.  </p1>
       <br>

    <h1>reading 6</h1>
      <p1> In her TED Talk, graduate student Joy Buolamwini discusses the harmfulness of 
      <br>
      algorithmic bias specific to facial recognition, and how it can result in unfairness<br>
       and discriminatory practices. For instance, AI machines can fail to recognize faces <br>
       that are darker in skin tone. Although this is a more day-to-day life situation, it<br>
        also extends to greater issues such as misidentifying suspected criminals. <br>
        Buolamwini says that full-spectrum training sets should be established so that <br>
        machines can be more inclusive of what “counts as a face.” At the end of the day, <br>
        it all comes down to the coders who create these digital systems. Thus, she states<br>
         that who codes matters, as well as how we code.

    <h1>reading 7</h1>
      <p1> Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s talk was about the harmfulness in representing a <br>
      race or place as one thing repeatedly, and as a result, telling a single story. She<br>
       goes into the backstory of her life: how she lived in Nigeria and how impressionable<br>
        she was as she read American and British children’s books. In university, she <br>
        felt “othered” and stereotyped by the people there, and faced the story that <br>
        people perceive about Africa and African people. As an international student <br>
        coming from Japan, I am definitely more conscious of my race and cultural background <br>
        at USC. Although I am very much bicultural and bilingual, there have definitely <br>
        been moments where I have felt discriminated against others who have grown up here. 
  <br>
The p5 Contributors Zine is a large collection of p5 works that help build community<br>
     and promote digital literacy. Some of the text emphasizes the importance in <br>
     maintaining an “explorative… relationship with the data collection process,” the <br>
     dangers of digital colonialism, and reindigenizing creative coding. This source<br>
      relates to the talk from earlier because they both talk about power struggles<br>
       within digital storytelling and how some voices are much louder than others. </1>

     <h1>reading 8</h1>
      <p1> In the beginning of the presentation, Ari Melenciano states that she uses <br>
      her art as a tool of activism. I thought her museum “353 Years Into the Future” <br>
      was very thought provoking, as I’ve never imagined what a world without racial<br>
      oppression would look like. Throughout all of her works, I can understand that <br>
      Melenciano thinks a lot about where humankind came from, where we are at and <br>
      where we are headed. I also appreciated her discussion on the importance of <br>
      changing human-centered design into ecologically-centered design. It really makes <br>
      me think about how easy it is to be distracted by how humans can benefit from <br>
      a design, without considering the environment. Overall, she seemed to have a <br>
      very coherent presentation that aims to look at the bigger picture, encouraging<br>
       others to contemplate about how to incorporate sustainability in design, rather<br>
        than think solely about short-term benefits.</p1>

     <h1>reading 9</h1>
      <p1> In her Ted Talk, Asian American artist Christine Sun Kim talks about her <br>
      story as a deaf artist. Her work focuses on drawing, performance, and video. <br>
      ASL makes up a big part of her work in order to visualize sound in her own way. <br>
      However, after researching more about her work, I saw that she also utilizes <br>
      dynamic notation (f and p) to express loudness or lack thereof. It was very <br>
      thought-provoking how she said that in deaf culture, movement = sound. Looking <br>
      at her pieces not only allows for a better understanding of how she perceives <br>
      sound, but also aspects of deaf culture that would be difficult to interpret <br>
      without art. <br> <br>

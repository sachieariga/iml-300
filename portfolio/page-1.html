      <p> Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology reminds me of middle school when I wanted to join the Computer Science club. Coding was something I always wanted to try in a classroom setting; however, because the club at my school was was male-dominated, I shyed away from it. Despite this experience, I am thankful to be living in a time where it is becoming increasingly normalized for women to be part of the computer science industry. They are being seen more as “programmers” rather than “female programmers.” 

One artist that really stood out to me in “Artist in Computer” was Leslie Mezei. Her ‘Bikini Shifted’ piece was very interesting, as she distorted her image in 121 different ways on a 11 x 11 grid. She presented these images in a way where it looks like a flip book. As an artist who struggles to try out new patterns or compositions in creative works, I admire the way she is able to create so many different iterations within her pieces.

      <p> This reading was very thought-provoking for me, especially as a Media Arts student who doesn't know much about computer terms and the history of computers. The way that the author merged the discussion of tech with race was interesting; for example, when it was mentioned that the transition from a black screen to a white screen on computers is a metaphor for the erasure of blackness, and the whiteness of the tech industry. I also took note of the visual layout of the article. The background is black throughout, and the text is white. This design relates to the writing especially when it says that “Blackness has, so to say, formed the ground for white, with black gooey being antithetical to the values of the white screen, (page 42).</p>

      <p>I found the reading interesting because it discussed "mediated" and "unmediated" content. Both this and the lecture on the beginning of the Internet made me want to compare the entertainment I consume online now vs when I first discovered the Internet. I wasn’t old enough to be using apps like Rando (mentioned in the writing); however, I do remember how amazed I was when I made friends on online magazine forums under the name “PuppyAndNatureLover777.” There wasn't an algorithm suggesting me to read certain comments or posts; I would simply scroll through the websites for hours, reading archived articles. Going back to Rando, I feel as though the app BeReal is a more developed version of it. Users are able to view a moment of random people’s days, everyday at a certain time. Users can record the location of the photo, “react” to others’ images via a selfie, and add a simple caption. It is interesting how an app with such a simple and random concept trended worldwide this year.

      <p>In the first portion Lauren McCarthy’s Eyeo talk, she discusses her “Following project” where she follows and observes strangers out in public. Although she was curious about how strangers around her lived their lives, McCarthy also aimed to find home through her project, as she had just moved to New York City and wished to explore her space. I often find myself looking at my phone or being distracted while walking on the streets, so it would be a refreshing experience to closely observe my surroundings. The presentation was also about Lauren, which is a human version of Amazon’s Alexa. I thought it was interesting that the speaker investigated the contrast between two opinions many have about modern technology: fearing surveillance vs wanting to be observed on platforms like social media. </p>

      <p>“In Defense of the Poor Image” discusses the presence of poor images, which have low resolution, spread quickly, and are remixed many times. Hito compares these images to imperfect cinema, which is amateurish and blurs “the distinction between consumer and producer, audience and author.” (page 39) Similarly, poor images can be seen as “popular images” that can be accessed and created by large communities. This is beneficial because they could form common interest between people who could not interact otherwise, but can also cause hate speech and misleading content. The writing really made me think about how I create, share, and view poor images online. I feel as though the “rough” format of these images provide a great sense of relatability; however, they could definitely be used the wrong way very easily.  </p>

      <p> In her TED Talk, graduate student Joy Buolamwini discusses the harmfulness of algorithmic bias specific to facial recognition, and how it can result in unfairness and discriminatory practices. For instance, AI machines can fail to recognize faces that are darker in skin tone. Although this is a more day-to-day life situation, it also extends to greater issues such as misidentifying suspected criminals. Buolamwini says that full-spectrum training sets should be established so that machines can be more inclusive of what “counts as a face.” At the end of the day, it all comes down to the coders who create these digital systems. Thus, she states that who codes matters, as well as how we code.

      <p> Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s talk was about the harmfulness in representing a race or place as one thing repeatedly, and as a result, telling a single story. She goes into the backstory of her life: how she lived in Nigeria and how impressionable she was as she read American and British children’s books. In university, she felt “othered” and stereotyped by the people there, and faced the story that people perceive about Africa and African people. As an international student coming from Japan, I am definitely more conscious of my race and cultural background at USC. Although I am very much bicultural and bilingual, there have definitely been moments where I have felt discriminated against others who have grown up here.

The p5 Contributors Zine is a large collection of p5 works that help build community and promote digital literacy. Some of the text emphasizes the importance in maintaining an “explorative… relationship with the data collection process,” the dangers of digital colonialism, and reindigenizing creative coding. This source relates to the talk from earlier because they both talk about power struggles within digital storytelling and how some voices are much louder than others. </p>

      <p> In the beginning of the presentation, Ari Melenciano states that she uses her art as a tool of activism. I thought her museum “353 Years Into the Future” was very thought provoking, as I’ve never imagined what a world without racial oppression would look like. Throughout all of her works, I can understand that Melenciano thinks a lot about where humankind came from, where we are at and where we are headed. I also appreciated her discussion on the importance of changing human-centered design into ecologically-centered design. It really makes me think about how easy it is to be distracted by how humans can benefit from a design, without considering the environment. Overall, she seemed to have a very coherent presentation that aims to look at the bigger picture, encouraging others to contemplate about how to incorporate sustainability in design, rather than think solely about short-term benefits.</p>

      <p> In her Ted Talk, Asian American artist Christine Sun Kim talks about her story as a deaf artist. Her work focuses on drawing, performance, and video. ASL makes up a big part of her work in order to visualize sound in her own way. However, after researching more about her work, I saw that she also utilizes dynamic notation (f and p) to express loudness or lack thereof. It was very thought-provoking how she said that in deaf culture, movement = sound. Looking at her pieces not only allows for a better understanding of how she perceives sound, but also aspects of deaf culture that would be difficult to interpret without art.

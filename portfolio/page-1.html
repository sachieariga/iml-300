           In this project called "Take Care," I decided to create a tribute for my mother,
             <br>
           who was the main person who raised me throughout childhood. Through the subtopics
             <br>
           of "people," "places," "things," and "words," I wish to describe the special <br>
        relationship that we had. A good chunk of the project creation included <br>
           poem-making, which was a new medium for me. I experimented with different CSS <br>
           effects on different pages, and added some of my iPad drawings as well. I went <br>
             with a winter theme for the cover slide because it ties into the <br>
             final "words" page.

           This project is an informational website that is centered around traditional <br>
           Japanese sushi. I display the dish as a craft of precision and a representation <br>
           of Japanese creativity. By moving abroad for the first time last year, I have <br>
           been able to consume a lot of fusion cuisine; however, I wished to create an <br>
           artistic platform that appreciates an aspect of traditional Japanese cuisine <br>
           specifically.  Although I believe that authentic Japanese sushi will be appreciated <br>
           worldwide for years to come, I wanted to educate others about the skill that is <br>
           required to make sushi, the etiquette that is encouraged while eating it, and the <br>
           history behind the dish itself. The subtopics include “history,” “types of sushi,” <br>
           “making sushi,” and “eating sushi." Despite the site’s informational nature, I wanted <br>
            to make the layout relatively simple without it being too wordy. I also gave myself <br>
            a challenge by drawing all the visual elements on the website. <br>
